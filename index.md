# Data Processors and their DPA resources

This collection aims to help you with establishing [GDPR](https://www.eugdpr.org/) compliance by concluding the required Data Processing Agreements (DPA) between you and the services you use that process personal data on your behalf (Data Processors).

It is curated by [Joschi Kuphal](https://github.com/jkphl), [Sebastian Greger](https://githob.com/sebastiangreger) and [Baltasar Cevc](https://github.com/bcevc) and complements their current [workshop series](https://colloq.io/events/datenschutz-im-web-fallstricke-strategien-risikomanagement-dsgvo) about data protection and ethical design issues.

> Please [send in pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for additions, updates and corrections. You can e.g. suggest additional data processors, their resources or URLs to conversations and comments on the web. Thanks for your kind support! ðŸ™‡
